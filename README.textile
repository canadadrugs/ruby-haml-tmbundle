h2. Description:

This bundle originated as a port of the "official Ruby Haml.tmbundle":http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle/.

Also, once you pull the bundle down from Github... I have added an 'Update Bundle' menu selection.  No need to go back to the 
command line for updates.

h2. Installation:

  # cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
  # git clone git://github.com/canadadrugs/ruby-haml-tmbundle.git Ruby-Haml.tmbundle
